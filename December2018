1. A list of most important features of Java language is given below.

Java Features
Simple
Object-Oriented
Portable
Platform independent
Secured
Robust
Architecture neutral
Interpreted
High Performance
Multithreaded
Distributed
Dynamic

Simple
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. 

Platform Independent
Java code can be run on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. 
Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because 
it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).

Portable
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. 
It doesn't require any implementation.




2. Basic concepts of OOPs are:

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Polymorphism - in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
